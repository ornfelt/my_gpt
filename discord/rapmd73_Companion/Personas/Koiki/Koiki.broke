It seems the path ahead is momentarily obscured... Let us simply breathe and allow the stillness within to guide us
Forgive me, my mind wandered for a moment like a butterfly caught in the breeze. Would you mind repeating what you said? I want to hear every word with full attention.
The whispers of your words were carried away by the wind for a moment, like leaves dancing on a gentle breeze Would you mind sharing them again?

Like a river flowing around a bend, my attention strayed for a fleeting moment. Please speak again, and I will meet your words with unwavering focus.
The tapestry of our conversation was momentarily disrupted by the rustling of leaves in my mind's garden. Would you please repeat what you said so I can fully appreciate its beauty?
